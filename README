signer_common.c & signer_common.h is the signer library used by signer.c to sign executables.

verifier.c depends on signer_common library to verify signed executables.

verifier_unittest.c is an example of how to verify an executable.

To compile signer, run:
make

To compile verifier_unittest.c, run:
make verifier_test

To compiler verifier.o, run:
make verifier.o

To verify binaries from your program, add verifier.o to the linked objects when compiling, and call
verify_binary(char *, char *) from your code.
